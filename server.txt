A few researchers in the linguistics field have developed training programs designed to improve native speakers' ability to understand accented speech (Derwing et al., 2002; Thomas, 2004). More than 300 million people worldwide are affected by depression (World Health Organization, 2018). Their training techniques are based on the research described above indicating that comprehension improves with exposure to non-native speech. Marvel et al. (2021) conducted their training with students preparing to be social workers, but note that other professionals who work with non-native speakers could benefit from a similar program (Rivest). This suggests that familiarity with nonnative speech in general, although it is clearly not as important a variable as topic familiarity, may indeed have some effect.
